      <h1> SHAPEAI Javascript and Reactjs BOOTCAMP</h1>
      <p>
        Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by{" "}
        <b> SHAPEAI</b>. The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha
        (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days
        and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. Here's the link
        for you to watch the sessions as well

        I got to have hands on experience on:
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>React.js</li>
        during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics
        so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. I enjoyed
        these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days
